# Quantum – Notebook Guide

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for Quantum Computing-based Machine Learning models. These notebooks explore various quantum algorithms and hybrid approaches applied to machine learning tasks.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab**. A local environment execution option will be released soon.

## Structure

- **QAE.ipynb**  
  Implements a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for dimensionality reduction or anomaly detection tasks using quantum circuits.

- **QEM_QNN.ipynb**  
  Combines Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) techniques with Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) to improve performance in noisy quantum environments.

- **QNN.ipynb**  
  Focuses on Quantum Neural Network models, demonstrating training and inference using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs).

- **QSVM Final.ipynb**  
  Applies Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for classification tasks, comparing results with classical SVM baselines.

## Usage

1. Open any notebook using Google Colab (Right-click → "Open with Colab", or upload to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)).
2. Follow the notebook instructions to install required dependencies (e.g., `qiskit`, `pennylane`, etc.).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. For local execution, a custom setup script and environment instructions will be made available shortly.

## Notes

- Designed for experimentation and research in quantum-enhanced machine learning.
- Ensure a stable internet connection when running on Colab with cloud-based quantum backends.
