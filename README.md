# Zenqor - Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Anomaly Detection

## Summary
A research-driven framework by Zenqor for detecting anomalies using Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs).

## Problem Solved
Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data. This project leverages the potential of quantum machine learning combined with classical techniques to improve anomaly detection performance in such scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- Python
- Django (backend in `src/`)
- Qiskit / PennyLane (for quantum components)
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Docker (planned deployment)
- OpenFaaS (for serverless execution, upcoming)

## 📦 Installation Steps
> Installation scripts for the full stack will be launched soon.

For now, ensure you have Python 3.12.4 installed and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run It

### For Notebooks
Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder. Each subfolder contains a self-contained guide and code tailored to specific datasets or anomaly detection experiments.

```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook
```

### For Django App (located in `src/`)
> Usage instructions and deployment guide for the Django app will be provided in the upcoming release.
